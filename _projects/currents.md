My thesis is based on a generalization of electrical current to higher
dimensions. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in quantization results for the
_current_ generated by sub-objects under stochastic motion. This breaks into
two cases: discrete (CW complexes with Markov processes) or continuous (smooth
manifolds with stochastic vector fields), and the tools involved vary for each.
One such tool in the discrete case are _higher spanning trees_, and we have
enumerated them using Reidemeister torsion, an invariant in Algebraic K-theory.
All of this work generalizes the 1-dimensional graph results of my advisors,
Vladimir Chernyak and John Klein. The interplay between these two settings also
provides a nice framework to compare invariants in one to those in the other,
e.g. Reidemeister to Ray-Singer torsion, using Witten-style deformations.
