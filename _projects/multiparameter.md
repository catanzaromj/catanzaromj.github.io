As a postdoc, I began work on geometric models for studying multiparameter
persistence. One of the first examples of ordinary persistence arose from
studying the sub-level sets of a Morse function. Together with Peter Bubenik,
we propose looking at generic families of Morse functions to study
multiparameter persistent homology. Using tools from geometric topology, we
attempt to build a decomposition of the associated multiparameter persistence
module, analogous to the barcode.
