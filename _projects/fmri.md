Certain types of imaging data, like fMRI, naturally lend themselves to analysis
using topological methods. The acquisition of an fMRI signal breaks a region of
interest up into three-dimensional voxels. This voxel structure can be used to
model the region by a cubical complex, a topological object which is amenable
to efficient homological calculations. This space acquires a natural filtration
via the fMRI signal, and so the methods of topological data analysis are
readily available. Using this set-up, we are currently working on understanding
how task modulation in the ACC can be understood using fMRI through the lens of
persistent homology. This project has several thrusts, which are joint with
Vaibhav Diwadkar, Sam Rizzo, Peter Bubenik, Andrew Salch, Adam Regalski, Hassan
Abdallah, and Raviteja Suryadevara.
