	title = {Topological {Decompositions} {Enhance} {Efficiency} of {Reinforcement} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Coordinating multiple sensors can be expressed as a reinforcement learning [RL] problem. Deep RL has excelled at observation processing (for example using convolution networks to process gridded data), but it suffers from sample inefficiency. To address this problem, we topologically decompose the total observation space into overlapping components, using the detection of co-incidence or spatial adjacency of the sensors to construct a stratified decomposition analogous. By allowing the RL agent to learn within the context of this decomposition and take advantage of it through action masking, we achieve positive reward and efficient gains over the learning process. We demonstrate performance and efficiency gains through several experiments using a bespoke game implementation that combines RLlib, Griddly, and Gymnasium. We draw analogies between our games and more general co-incidence in sensing space, time, or modality. We find that our decomposition can be combined with modern RL algorithms to learn high-performing sensor control policies, and our pipeline scales well as the number of sensors grows.},

A list of conditions for when a Hodge decomposition theorem holds in this setting is given and we apply this theory to finite CW complexes.

We show how the coefficients of usual discrete harmonic chains due to Eckmann can be reduced to localizations of the integers, allowing us to compare classical harmonicity with the notion introduced here.

  abstract = {BOLD-based fMRI is the most widely used method for studying brain function. The BOLD signal while valuable, is beset with unique vulnerabilities. The most notable of these is the modest signal to noise ratio, and the relatively low temporal and spatial resolution. However, the high dimensional complexity of the BOLD signal also presents unique opportunities for functional discovery. Topological Data Analyses (TDA), a branch of mathematics optimized to search for specific classes of structure within high dimensional data may provide particularly valuable applications. In this investigation, we acquired fMRI data in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using a basic motor control paradigm. Then, for each participant and each of three task conditions, fMRI signals in the ACC were summarized using two methods: a) TDA based methods of persistent homology and persistence landscapes and b) non-TDA based methods using a standard vectorization scheme. Finally, using machine learning (with support vector classifiers), classification accuracy of TDA and non-TDA vectorized data was tested across participants. In each participant, TDA-based classification out-performed the non-TDA based counterpart, suggesting that our TDA analytic pipeline better characterized task- and condition-induced structure in fMRI data in the ACC. Our results emphasize the value of TDA in characterizing task- and condition-induced structure in regional fMRI signals. In addition to providing our analytical tools for other users to emulate, we also discuss the unique role that TDA-based methods can play in the study of individual differences in the structure of functional brain signals in the healthy and the clinical brain.},

present MSF Designer, an interactive visualization tool that supports the combinatorial exploration of Morse–Smale functions on the
sphere. Our tool supports the design and visualization of a Morse–Smale function in a simple way using fundamental moves, which are
combinatorial operations introduced by Catanzaro et al. that modify the Morse–Smale graph of the function. It also provides fine-grained
control over the geometry and topology of its gradient vector field. The tool is designed to help mathematicians explore the complex
configuration spaces of Morse–Smale functions, as well as their associated gradient vector fields and Morse–Smale complexes.
Understanding these spaces will help mathematicians expand their applicability in topological data analysis and visualization. In
particular, our tool helps topologists, geometers, and combinatorialists explore invariants in the classification of vector fields and
characterize Morse functions in the persistent homology setting.},

abstract = {Attachment of chemical substituents (such as polar moieties) constitutes an efficient and convenient way to modify physical and chemical properties of conjugated polymers and oligomers. Associated modifications in the molecular electronic states can be comprehensively described by examining scattering of excitons in the polymer?s backbone at the scattering center representing the chemical substituent. Here, we implement effective tight-binding models as a tool to examine the analytical properties of the exciton scattering matrices in semi-infinite polymer chains with substitutions. We demonstrate that chemical interactions between the substitution and attached polymer are adequately described by the analytical properties of the scattering matrices. In particular, resonant and bound electronic excitations are expressed via the positions of zeros and poles of the scattering amplitude, analytically continued to complex values of exciton quasi-momenta. We exemplify the formulated concepts by analyzing excited states in conjugated phenylacetylenes substituted by perylene.},

abstract = {Driven Langevin processes have appeared in a variety of fields due to the relevance of natural phenomena having both deterministic and stochastic effects. The stochastic currents and fluxes in these systems provide a convenient set of observables to describe their non-equilibrium steady states. Here we consider stochastic motion of a ( k - 1 ) -dimensional object, which sweeps out a k-dimensional trajectory, and gives rise to a higher k-dimensional current. By employing the low-temperature (low-noise) limit, we reduce the problem to a discrete Markov chain model on a CW complex, a topological construction which generalizes the notion of a graph. This reduction allows the mean fluxes and currents of the process to be expressed in terms of solutions to the discrete Supersymmetric Fokker–Planck (SFP) equation. Taking the adiabatic limit, we show that generic driving leads to rational quantization of the generated higher dimensional current. The latter is achieved by implementing the recently developed tools, coined the higher-dimensional Kirchhoff tree and co-tree theorems. This extends the study of motion of extended objects in the continuous setting performed in the prequel (Catanzaro et al.) to this manuscript.},

abstract = {The probability distributions, as well as the mean values of stochastic currents and fluxes, associated with a driven Langevin process, provide a good and topologically protected measure of how far a stochastic system is driven out of equilibrium. By viewing a Langevin process on a compact oriented manifold of arbitrary dimension m as a theory of a random vector field associated with the environment, we are able to consider stochastic motion of higher-dimensional objects, which allow new observables, called higher-dimensional currents, to be introduced. These higher dimensional currents arise by counting intersections of a k -dimensional trajectory, produced by a evolving ( k - 1 ) -dimensional cycle, with a reference cross section, represented by a cycle of complimentary dimension ( m - k ) . We further express the mean fluxes in terms of the solutions of the Supersymmetric Fokker–Planck (SFP), thus generalizing the corresponding well-known expressions for the conventional currents.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, we consider stochastic motion of subcomplexes of a CW complex, and explore the implications on the underlying space. The random process on the complex is motivated from Ito diffusions on smooth manifolds and Langevin processes in physics. We associate a Kolmogorov equation to this process, whose solutions can be interpretted in terms of generalizations of electrical, as well as stochastic, current to higher dimensions. These currents also serve a key function in relating the random process to the topology of the complex. We show the average current generated by such a process can be written in a physically familiar form, consisting of the solution to Kirchhoff’s network problem and the Boltzmann distribution, suitably generalized to arbitrary dimensions. We analyze these two components in detail, and discover they reveal an unexpected amount of information about the topology of the CW complex. The main result is a quantization result for the average current in the low temperature, adiabatic limit. As an application, we express the Reidemeister torsion of the complex, a topological invariant, in terms of these quantities.},

abstract = {fMRI is the preeminent method for collecting signals from the human brain in vivo, for using these signals in the service of functional discovery, and relating these discoveries to anatomical structure. Numerous computational and mathematical techniques have been deployed to extract information from the fMRI signal. Yet, the application of Topological Data Analyses (TDA) remain limited to certain sub-areas such as connectomics (that is, with summarized versions of fMRI data). While connectomics is a natural and important area of application of TDA, applications of TDA in the service of extracting structure from the (non-summarized) fMRI data itself are heretofore nonexistent. “Structure” within fMRI data is determined by dynamic fluctuations in spatially distributed signals over time, and TDA is well positioned to help researchers better characterize mass dynamics of the signal by rigorously capturing shape within it. To accurately motivate this idea, we a) survey an established method in TDA (“persistent homology”) to reveal and describe how complex structures can be extracted from data sets generally, and b) describe how persistent homology can be applied specifically to fMRI data. We provide explanations for some of the mathematical underpinnings of TDA (with expository figures), building ideas in the following sequence: a) fMRI researchers can and should use TDA to extract structure from their data; b) this extraction serves an important role in the endeavor of functional discovery, and c) TDA approaches can complement other established approaches toward fMRI analyses (for which we provide examples). We also provide detailed applications of TDA to fMRI data collected using established paradigms, and offer our software pipeline for readers interested in emulating our methods. This working overview is both an inter-disciplinary synthesis of ideas (to draw researchers in TDA and fMRI toward each other) and a detailed description of methods that can motivate collaborative research.},

abstract = {We develop a method for calculating the persistence landscapes of affine fractals using the parameters of the corresponding transformations. Given an iterated function system of affine transformations that satisfies a certain compatibility condition, we prove that there exists an affine transformation acting on the space of persistence landscapes, which intertwines the action of the iterated function system. This latter affine transformation is a strict contraction and its unique fixed point is the persistence landscape of the affine fractal. We present several examples of the theory as well as confirm the main results through simulations.},

abstract = {We introduce a model for random chain complexes over a finite field. The randomness in our complex comes from choosing the entries in the matrices that represent the boundary maps uniformly over q , conditioned on ensuring that the composition of consecutive boundary maps is the zero map. We then investigate the combinatorial and homological properties of this random chain complex.},
