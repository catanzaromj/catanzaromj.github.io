Hello! 

I am a mathematician turned data scientist interested in solving
problems in big data and machine learning. Lately I've been working on
simplifying machine learning problems using the tools of algebraic topology.
Before this, I studied topological data analysis and its applications on a 
variety of applied problems, ranging from understanding deep perception models
to analyzing fMRI data. Once upon a time, I studied stochastic topology and
empirical currents.

I am currently a Senior Scientist at Geometric Data Analytics, Inc. Prior to this,
I was an Assistant Professor in the mathematics department at Iowa State University,
a postdoc at the Unviersity of Florida, and a graduate student at Wayne State University.
I earned my PhD in 2016 under the supervision of John Klein and Vladimir Chernyak and 
was mentored by Peter Bubenik as a postdoc.

I like to do lots of other things besides research in math, physics, machine learning, and 
artificial intelligence (like golf).
